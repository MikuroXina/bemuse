## How do I adjust the speed?

You can change the scrolling speed in-game using these keys:

- **ArrowUp**: Increase speed by 0.5x
- **ArrowDown**: Decrease speed by 0.5x.
- **Alt+ArrowUp**: Increase speed by 0.1x
- **Alt+ArrowDown**: Decrease speed by 0.1x.

## There is a huge audio latency\! Can it be fixed?

Bemuse attempts to use the lowest latency available to a web application. There are many factors that affect the latency in game.

- **Operating system and browser**: Many Windows machines comes with an onboard sound card with quite a high latency (100ms), and using an external audio interface may help. On a Mac, Safari generally gives the lowest latency.
- **Hardware**: Wired headphones work best. Wireless headphones, speakers, and TVs generally have higher latency.

Bemuse has a **delay compensation** system to improve the gameplay even if you cannot reduce the latency. Open the options screen, and click on the “Calibrate” button to find out your system’s audio+input latency.

## The game runs poorly in my browser!

If you're getting low FPS while playing Bemuse, please make sure you have hardware acceleration turned on to make the game run smoothly.
Here's how to turn it on in different browsers:

- **Chrome (and Microsoft Edge)**: Settings > Show advanced settings > System > Use hardware acceleration when available
- **Firefox**: Options > Performance > Use recommended performance settings
- **Safari**: Hardware acceleration is enabled by default.
